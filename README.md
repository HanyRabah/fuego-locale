fuego-locale
============

Located here are the locale files for Fuego. Please make sure to set --locale to a dialect specific language when running makemessages.

For example:

```
python manage.py makemessages --locale=ar_BH --settings=fuego.bahrain_settings --ignore=fuego/egypt_settings.py
```

... for now. Until we find a better solution.

All translations are stored in these dialect buckets
